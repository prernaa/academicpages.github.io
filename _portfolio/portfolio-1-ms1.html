<p><strong>Background:</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic has broad negative impact on the physical and mental health of people with chronic neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> We presented a machine learning approach leveraging passive sensor data from smartphones and fitness trackers of people with MS to predict their health outcomes in a natural experiment during a state-mandated stay-at-home period due to a global pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>Methods:</strong> First, we extracted features that capture behavior changes due to the stay-at-home order. Then, we adapted and applied an existing algorithm to these behavior-change features to predict the presence of depression, high global MS symptom burden, severe fatigue, and poor sleep quality during the stay-at-home period.</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> Using data collected between November 2019 and May 2020, the algorithm detected depression with an accuracy of 82.5% (65% improvement over baseline; F1-score: 0.84), high global MS symptom burden with an accuracy of 90% (39% improvement over baseline; F1-score: 0.93), severe fatigue with an accuracy of 75.5% (22% improvement over baseline; F1-score: 0.80), and poor sleep quality with an accuracy of 84% (28% improvement over baseline; F1-score: 0.84).</p>

<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> Our approach could help clinicians better triage patients with MS and potentially other chronic neurological
disorders for interventions and aid patient self-monitoring in their own environment, particularly during extraordinarily stressful
circumstances such as pandemics, which would cause drastic behavior changes.</p>
