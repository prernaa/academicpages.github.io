<p><strong>My Contributions:</strong> Led the design and implementation of the emoji-first messaging paradigm. Implemented the prototype as an iOS app written in Swift using SwiftUI and TensorFlow Lite. The app design process was iterative where I tweaked the app based on feedback from pilot participants. Conducted a field study with 22 participants, followed by surveys and user interviews. Leveraged grounded theory to open code interview transcripts, and used thematic analysis/ card sorting to identify themes that identified how the users used EmoChat, the affordances that emoji-first messaging offers, and the pain points and limitations. Presented my findings and discussed design implications for future products at Snap with the HCI team. Led paper writing.
