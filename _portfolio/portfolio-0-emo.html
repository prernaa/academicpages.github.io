<p>Emoji are known to have a strong impact on emotions and positively affect relationships. People in close relationships use emoji in very personalized and secretive ways, thereby forming a shared vocabulary. In this project, we present EmoChat, an emoji-first messaging app for pairs of users in close relationships that leverages the pair's closeness and shared experiences to create a highly personalized "communication zone" with the goal of enhancing communication. In EmoChat, each message is fully translated to emoji. The recipient always sees the emoji first, but can view the text on demand with a tap. Through a field study, we investigated the affordances of personalized emoji-first messaging for close relationships, and we found that emoji-first messaging contributes the following values to text messaging: it adds to humor; it builds secrecy for the exchange of private messages; it promotes creativity, gamification, fun, and play; and it promotes companionship through affection and the sharing of perspectives. To the best of our knowledge, EmoChat is the first ever emoji-first messaging app. Our work created a new paradigm for messaging that enables the communication of lightweight symbols before text and has implications for the future ecosystem of communication apps. </p>

<p><strong>My Contributions:</strong> Led the design and implementation of the emoji-first messaging paradigm. Implemented the prototype as an iOS app written in Swift using SwiftUI and TensorFlow Lite. The app design process was iterative where I tweaked the app based on feedback from pilot participants. Conducted a field study with 22 participants, followed by surveys and user interviews. Leveraged grounded theory to open code interview transcripts, and used thematic analysis/ card sorting to identify themes that identified how the users used EmoChat, the affordances that emoji-first messaging offers, and the pain points and limitations. Presented my findings and discussed design implications for future products at Snap with the HCI team. Led paper writing.
