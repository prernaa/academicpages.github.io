I'm a PhD in [Human-Computer Interaction](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"} student at Carnegie Mellon University's [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My research develops **data science methods and data-driven user interfaces for understanding and augmenting human behavior**, with the goal of improving high-impact application areas like health, well-being, computer-mediated communication, and team collaboration. 

To develop these methods and interfaces, I leverage my diverse skills in behavioral statistics, machine learning, natural language processing, speech processing, and computer vision to analyze datasets from multiple modalities like smartphone and wearable data, web interaction logs, text and speech data, face and body video, and electronic health records. I also develop user interfaces using iterative prototyping, run user studies, and utilize qualitative methods such as user interviews and thematic analysis in my work.

My work has been published in top-tier HCI venues, including ACM CHI, IMWUT (UbiComp), CSCW, TOCHI, and JMIR, and has also been covered by media publications such as Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and Harvard Business Review. 

I have been a part of research teams at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/){:target="_blank"} and [Snap Research](https://research.snap.com/){:target="_blank"}, and have collaborated on research projects with clinicians and the [University of Pittsburgh Medical Center](https://www.upmc.com/){:target="_blank"}. I was awarded the [Center for Machine Learning and Health Fellowship](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/cmlh/digital-health-archive/cmlh-digital-health-fellows-2017){:target="_blank"}, and the [Snap Research Fellowship](https://research.snap.com/fellowships.html){:target="_blank"}. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I completed a [MS in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, and a [B.Eng. in Computer Science from Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse){:target="_blank"}.

> I'm currently on the job market for industry positions related to research and project development, as well as post-doctoral positions. You can reach me at pchikersal[@]gmail.com.
