I'm a PhD in [Human-Computer Interaction](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"} student at Carnegie Mellon University's [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I work at the intersection of Applied Machine Learning, Human-Computer Interaction, and Ubiquitous Computing. I develop multimodal machine learning methods and systems to understand and augment human behavior, with the goal of improving health, wellbeing, and performance. My work has been published in top-tier HCI venues, including ACM CHI (IMWUT), IMWUT (UbiComp), CSCW, TOCHI, and JMIR, and has also been covered by media publications such as Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and Harvard Business Review. 

I have been a part of research teams at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/){:target="_blank"} and [Snap Research](https://research.snap.com/){:target="_blank"}, and have collaborated on research projects with clinicians and the [University of Pittsburgh Medical Center](https://www.upmc.com/){:target="_blank"}. I was awarded the [Center for Machine Learning and Health Fellowship](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/cmlh/digital-health-archive/cmlh-digital-health-fellows-2017){:target="_blank"}, and the [Snap Research Fellowship](https://research.snap.com/fellowships.html){:target="_blank"}. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I completed a [MS in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, and a [B.Eng. in Computer Science from Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse){:target="_blank"}.
